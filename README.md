# Fofoka

> Fofoka stands for gossip in Portuguese, but with "k" in place of "c"

Gossip is a rumor that is spread by one person to others. Just like epidemics, a single infected person could later infect the entire world.

Gossip is a multicast protocol. It differs from centralized multicast protocols by eliminating the need to rely on one node to send a message. All nodes receive the message, but not all nodes need to send messages.
